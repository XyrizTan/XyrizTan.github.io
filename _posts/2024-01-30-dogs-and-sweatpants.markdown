Hi, it's me again, short life update: Dog is in his teenager years now, he has now access to the garage for outside playpen play time, he never runs out of energy now! He now associates the word "fetch" to bringing his toy back that he sometimes leaves behind whenever his short attention span suddenly shifts to random sounds and shiny scraps.

Wifey will be staying at a place near her work for the first half of the week, how to explain to our doggy that it will be hella confusing because she won't be home on some days :<

I entered my sweatpants era (because mosquitoes looove me and I want something that the dog can accidentally damage), ordered 3 different sweatpants from different brands. I never wanted to change out from Uniqlo's Dry Stretch sweatpants. Currently wearing Amazon Essentials sweatpants, it's pretty decent and warm. I'd let you know on the next update how this remaining Champion Powerblend sweatpant feels. America's sizes are 1 size larger than Asia, and Uniqlo's sizes are, in my opinion, 1 size smaller than standard (L Shirt fits me but lacks length, Winnie the Pooh tier?)

Update: Champion Powerblend is pretty great too, deep pockets, fashionable fit, though the fabric feels a bit scratchy?
