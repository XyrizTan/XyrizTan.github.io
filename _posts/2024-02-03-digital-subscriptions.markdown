I thought about sharing here what monthly digital services we pay for, and why we pay for it, so here we go!

Google One
- 89 PHP per month for 100GB, mostly for backing up phone photos, thinking of scrapping this one soon and just opt for the free tier where you sell your photos as AI training data and forces you to only keep a compressed format for your photos.

YouTube Premium
- Family membership 239 PHP per month, very, very utilized on our TV,  phones, and iPad. I pay automatically through Maya digital bank so that I can take advantage of its increased interest rate on your savings when you do monthly recurring payments.

Honkai Star Rail
- Express Pass 299 PHP, I cover the cost of this using the interest gained from digital banks like Seabank (dumping 100K PHP there gives you around 330 PHP of interest in 30 days.)

Amazon Prime
- 3 SGD (125 PHP) per month, includes Amazon Video, might be unsubscribing soon because the real reason I only got it is because of  Twitch Prime (Riot Games will be stopping their Twitch partnership, so bye-bye free in-game loots for LoL, TFT, Valorant, LoR.)

Netflix
- 549 PHP per month for Premium 4K+HDR up to 4 simultaneous devices, we also shared the credentials to my parents and parents-in-law, great value!
- Anime, K-Drama, Documentaries galore
- Actual 4K HDR content for our OLED TV

Evernote
- This serves as my digital journal for all things that needs noting down: thoughts, goals, drafts (like for this blog entry), grocery list, to-dos, jotting down updates for daily sync at work, memos, templates.
- 1200 PHP (22 USD) for a year of subscription for the Personal plan.
- I have already sought out other alternatives like Microsoft OneNote (I am also paying for MS 365, see below), but when I did give it a chance a few years ago, it doesn't have the same straightforward use-case that I'm looking for. OneNote functions more like an actual notebook where you make sections that behave like post-it notes. Also you can't have customizable tags, also OneNote tags its contents per line not per page (I want it to behave more like a blog entry tags.)

Microsoft 365
- I mainly pay for the 1TB of cloud storage where I store all my travel photos and videos, the Microsoft apps are just a bonus, in my opinion. Now also comes with premium Microsoft Editor (a browser extension much like Grammarly)
- 103 SGD (4300 PHP) annually for a family plan (up to 5 more people)

Phone plan
- I still pay 20 SGD (835 PHP) for my phone plan (GOMO) in Singapore because I still need a local SG number to be tied with our Singpass (SG's national ID app, very important to have this!) Also makes mobile OTP for different SG app services still possible through SMS roaming.
- For phone plan in the Philippines, I use prepaid and only bought Smart's Magic Data+ 749 I think only once, it comes with 48 GB MAGIC DATA FOR ALL SITES + 600 Mins Allnet Calls + 600 Allnet Texts (NO EXPIRY.) Not many people know this because Smart deliberately hides this insanely great value package.

Grab
- Grab Unlimited for 240 PHP per year, (almost) free delivery with a minimum spend of 475 PHP. No brainer to get if you avail food delivery services at least once a month (we love getting Indian food at least once a month.)

That's all for now, for the next post I'm thinking of talking about how much is our puppy upkeep. Stay tuned!
