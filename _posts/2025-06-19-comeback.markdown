"Done is better than perfect."

That is a saying that I should be mindful of more often. I recall I always had "updating my blog" in my to-do and I have always put it off because I wanted to have a nice gallery of photos along with the documenting of my Japan trip.

I ended up not posting about it at all because I wanted it to be prim and proper with the blog narrative going along with attached photos.

Here we are more than a year from the last post from February 2024. I'll be retroactively adding posts once I figure out some stuff regarding post layout with photos.

A lot has changed since then, puppy grew up, took a refresher driving course, bought a nice new car, wife and I were expecting, tons of hospital visits and learning all about pregnancy and parenthood, took my online N4 Japanese classes in July - passed the JLPT N4 exam in December, re-entered the workforce, started weight training (again), and finally, currently obsessing on our bundle of joy.

Two things I have to keep in mind. 
Done is better than perfect.
Keep the momentum, start small, then slowly work on setting larger goals.
